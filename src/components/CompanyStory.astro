      <p>
        Founded in 2013 by industry veterans, Bitcraft was born from a simple belief: software
        should be <em>crafted</em>, not just coded.
      </p>

      <p>
        The name says it all — <strong>"bit"</strong> for the digital world we work in,
        <strong>"craft"</strong> for the care and skill we bring to every project. We treat every line
        of code as a piece of craftsmanship, because we believe the details matter.
      </p>

      <p>
        After years building products at companies of all sizes, we saw too much software built to
        just ship fast and break things. We wanted to do better — to work with founders and teams
        who value quality, think long-term, and want a genuine partner in their journey.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today, we work with startups, small businesses, and entrepreneurs who share our belief that
        great software takes time, thought, and care. Whether it's a web application, mobile app, or
        backend system — we build things right.
